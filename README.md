# Teme
Code autograding platform for teachers and students of programming

## OVERVIEW
Teme (pronounced Teh- meh) is a platform that allows instructors to set up programming assignments and students to submit solutions to these assignments that are given a grade based on how well they meet some standard set by the instructor.

The name Teme is a word in the Dholuo language that means try. It is a platform that should encourage people to try out programming. It encourages the students to try to submit solutions, encourages the instructor to create problems and encourages the community to try and improve the platform. The platform considers the learning of programming similar to the building of some physical muscle. Therefore, it uses language that would seem familiar to people who have been to the gym to build their muscle. Of course you dont need to have been to the gym to use the platform.
